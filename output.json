To\nproduce high reliability and consistency in your data, you need to provide\nrespondents with enough answer choices to distinguish between different\nopinions. However, you also don’t want to provide so many answer choices that\nrespondents with the same opinion are likely to select different options. So\nwhile including more scale points allows for higher differentiation and\nvalidity, including fewer scale points produces more reliability and\nconsistency. The art of selecting the right point scale comes down to optimizing\nfor both qualities. According to survey methodology research, the optimal number\nof scale points ranges from 5-9. Within that range, the number of response\noptions you offer will depend on whether differentiation or reliability is more\nimportant as well as which method you use to field the survey.  For example, due\nto smaller screen sizes, we recommend using a 5-point scale for surveys","metadata":{"source":"docs/expert_answers.html","line":123,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}},{"pageContent":"2. What is a “Likert scale?”A Likert scale refers to a centrally weighted scale.\nThis means that there are an equal number of choices on either side of a neutral\nmidpoint. Likert scales are common and frequently expressed as a 5-point scale,\nwith “undecided” as the middle option. However, any odd-numbered scale –\n7-points, 9-points, etc. – could technically fall into this category as well.\nRegardless of the total number of points, this type of scale assumes\nequidistance between each point, and because it is centrally weighted, it gives\nthe respondent an “out” at the midpoint to indicate neutrality (e.g., “I am\nneither satisfied nor dissatisfied”).","metadata":{"source":"docs/expert_answers.html","line":119,"loc":{"lines":{"from":1,"to":1}}}}],"answer":"According to the context, a 5-point scale is recommended for surveys due to its ability to provide more reliability and consistency in data."}}
