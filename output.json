We can use this to create a request to upload a survey response with file attachments. A minimum of two body parts are required in addition to the files you wish to upload.\\\\n>1. `response`: This body part is the JSON representation of the survey response. As with the regular `application/json` POST request for this endpoint, the minimum required object is `{\\\\\\\"values\\\\\\\": {}}`.

Its purpose is to tell the importer which files go with which questions in your survey. E.g. if we wanted to import a file with the body part key of `file1` and we wanted that file to be associated with the file upload question `QID1`, our `fileMapping` object would be `{\\\\\\\"file1\\\\\\\": \\\\\\\"QID1\\\\\\\"}`.\\\\n>For the remainder of your request you can attach up to five files.
